# Mini-processor-build-on-the-FPGA
<br /> Using FPGA build a processor and design an application on it
<br />
<br /> Designed ALU, program counter, memory, reg files, data path, and finite state machine on FPGA. Designed IO system,
java-to-assembly system, tiny shell, and pixie wranglers applications on the designed processor.
<br /> Improved the calculation speed by 25% by using the program counter on both positive and negative edges of the FPGA when
applying the signal instructions.
